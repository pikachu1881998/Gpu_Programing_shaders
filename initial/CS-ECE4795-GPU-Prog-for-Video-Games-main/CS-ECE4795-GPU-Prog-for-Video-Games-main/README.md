The material shown here is relevant to both the Summer 2020 and Summer 2021 offerings of the class; any year 2020 material listed here is being reused in the 2021 version of the calss, and will probably work in versions of Unity from 2019.4 up to 2021.1 (and hopefully later, but who knows). Some minor tweaking may be needed.

The GPU20IntroShaders unitypackage corresponds to Lectures 16 through 24; the GPU20EnvMapShaders unitypackage corresponds to Lecture 25; and the GPU20ProjTexShaders unitypackage corresponds to Lecture 27.

When trying out one of the unitypackages, start with a blank vanilla "3D" project, and drag the unitypackage onto the Assets folder. If it gives you a warning about a scene file changing on disk or something like that, don't worry about it, just click through the warning. The assets will then be loaded, but you won't see anything new in the scene; you need to go to the scene folder and double-click on one of the particular scenes to load it.
