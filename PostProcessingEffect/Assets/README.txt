This demo uses Unity's Post-Processing Stack (v2), which must be installed via the Package Manager. The smoothest user experience arises from installing the PPS package first and then importing the GPU21PostProcBuiltinRP.unitypacakage. If the PPS package is installed after the GPU21PostProc package is imported, you will need to reimport the GPU21DepthNormalStack.shader and GPU21OutlinerStackShader.shader files in the "Shaders and Support" folder.

The animated models were free models found on the Unity Asset Store. The horse was by Tom Higgens, under the publisher name "Dootsy Development." Alas, it is no longer on the store, and the www.dootsy.co.uk website appears to be defunct. I also can't seem to find the skeleton model now either, and unfortunately don't seem to have any record as to who made it. If you know, please e-mail me at lanterma@ece.gatech.edu.
